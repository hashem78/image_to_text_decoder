VLC (or possibly libavcodec) does handle some surprising things like playing an mp3 file that has been renamed to wav.
I
believe
it
tries
the
obvious
codec
(based
on
extension)
and
if
that
fails
to
parse,
it
falls
back
to
a
slower
"probe"
-
trying
each
C(
in turn and assigning a score for how well it matches.
Possibly the "insert space" hack causes it to go through the slower "probe" path which gets a better answer.
What extension do the mjpeg files have? Or is this being piped without a filename?
